## Jump to P+K if (Xj) not in range

In IEEE floating-point, a value is *in range* if it is neither an infinity nor a **NaN** (Not-a-Number).

An infinity can be generated by
1. An arithmetic computation that overflows the largest representable number (e.g., adding two very large positive numbers);
2. An arithmetic computation that underflows the smallest representable number (e.g., adding two very large absolute value negative numbers);
3. Dividing a positive number by 0 (e.g., $`1.0/0 = +\infty`$);
4. Dividing a negative number by 0 (e.g., $`-1.0/0 = -\infty`$).

A **NaN** is generated when the result of an arithmetic operation is undefined (e.g., $` 0 \times \infty =`$ **NaN**).
**NaN**s typically *propagate*: Most operations involving a **NaN** will produce a **NaN** as the result.
